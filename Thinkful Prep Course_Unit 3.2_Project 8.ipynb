    "<font size = \"2\"> You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?</br>\n",

    "Before choosing a door, there is a 1/3 probability that I would select the door that contains the prize(car). After the host reveals a door containing a dud, two doors remain to choose from, one of which contains a car. \n",

    "Using Bayes'rule, there is a 0% probability that the host will select the door that has the car. As this decision does not happen in a vacuum, the chances of one of the closed doors containing the car are 2/3, not 1/2.\n",
